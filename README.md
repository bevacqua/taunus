> Micro Isomorphic MVC. Progressive Enhancement. Content-First. Single-Page Applications (that are also server-side rendered). Predictive Caching. Bring Your Own View Engine.

Taunus aims to simplify the state of MVC and shared rendering using [convention over configuration][2]. Taunus will handle routing,  allow you to lay out controllers and view templates independently for each view.

# Documentation

# Development

Install dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

You can analyze the bundle size using the command below.

```shell
npm run diagnose
```

# Tests

Taunus has unit tests for both the client-side and the server-side. Run them both with `npm`.

```shell
npm test
```

You can also run them individually.

```shell
npm run test-server
npm run test-client
```

<sub>Note that during CI a different test harness is used for the client-side _(the `test-client-ci` script)_, but the tests stay the same.</sub>

# Continuous Integration

The server-side test suite is [serviced by Travis CI][11].
